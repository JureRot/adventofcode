this is our input (represents a program run with assembly commands)
first we will translate it into something more "code like language" (here we use javascript)
thus we will be able to see the loops more easily and optimise it
set, sub and mul commands are pretty straight forward
but jnz commands can become one of two things
if statement (jnz x 2) (jumps over next command if x not zero)
do while loop (jnz x -8) (goes back to the beginning of the loop if x not zero)


var a=1, b, c, d, e, f, g, h=0;


#set b 93				--
b = 93;					  \
#set c b				   |
c = b;					   |
#jnz a 2 				   |
#jnz 1 5 #skiped, a is set to 1		    \
#mul b 100				     --	this is all initiation (will be exectude just once)
b = b*100				    /
#sub b -100000				   |
b = b+100000				   |
#set c b				   |
c = b					   |
#sub c -17000				  /
c = c+17000				--

#same as saying
b = 109300
c = 126300
