        I finally did day 11 and wanted to compare with your hints afterwards.

        I represented a node in the search space as he current floor number plus the set of the (generator-floor, chip-floor) pairs.
        Then a function that finds all neighboring states plus a function that sums all distances to floor 4 as heuristic.
        After that it was enough to thorw those at A*.
        I think that implements all your hints which is kind of fun because the basic approach seems so different.
