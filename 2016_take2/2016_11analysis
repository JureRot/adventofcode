If you can move two items upstairs, don't bother bringing one item upstaris.
If you can move one item downstairs, don't bother bringing two items downstairs.
(but still try to move items downstaris even if you can move items upstaris)

Let's say I'm on a floor with a HG and HC and a LG and LC.
And let's say that I've decided that my next move will be to move one of the two chips up a floor.
Does it matter WHICH chip i move?

ESSENTIAL:
All pairs are interchangeable
the following two states are equivalent:
HG@0, HC@1, LG@2, LC@2
LG@0, LC@1, HG@2, HC@2
(=HG@2, HC@2, LG@0, LC@1)
prune any state equivalent to (not just equal to) a state you have already seen!
